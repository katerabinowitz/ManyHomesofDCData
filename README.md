# ManyHomesofDCData
DC data lives in many different locations in many different formats - it may be on the official DC open data website, (briefly) live on a Dropbox folder for a hackathon, tucked away on an agency website, or an individual's Github. It can be difficult to navigate and even know if the data you want exists. Here's hoping this provides a modicum of clarity, making it easier for people to find the data they need and identify areas where data is needed. This list will also help inform a new [Code for DC Open Data Portal](http://data.codefordc.org/). 

Please contribute to the list! You can do so by:
* Submitting an issue
* Making a pull request
* E-mailing me at datalensdc@gmail.com

Or, if you there's particular data you want but don't know where it lives, submit an issue or e-mail me! We can find or FOIA it.
